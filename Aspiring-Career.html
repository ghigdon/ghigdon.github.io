    <h1>About my banking career</h1>
    <p>
      I work at a community bank named Oak View National Bank. It currently has
      3 branches located in Warrenton, Marshall, and Culpeper, Virginia.<br />
      I started my banking career in late 2018 as a part-time teller. Soon
      after, I became what is known in many banks as a "floating teller." As the
      name implies, I "floated" between the branches to fill-in as needed. As of
      the beginning of 2021, I was promoted the position of "loan assistant" in
      the loan department of my bank. I have discovered, however, that loans are
      not something that I am passionate about.
