      The volt is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. Therefore, it must be charged if the owner desires to drive the
      vehicle using the 16 kilowatt hour battery. Otherwise, they must use the
      gas generator to power the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 4rem">Charging the Volt is simple. You simply open the charging port, located just in front
      of the driver's door, and then plug your charging cable into the socket, as displayed in the picture above. The vehicle
      can be charged using a regular 120-volt household outlet, which means that it can be charged anywhere where an outlet
      available. Using a regular outlet takes approximately 10-13 hours to charge from a dead charge to a full charge.
      Alternatively, the vehicle can be charged using a 240-volt charger, which takes the charging time down to 3-4 hours. </p>
