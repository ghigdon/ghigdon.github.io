    <h1>What I am studying in College</h1>
    <p>
      After graduating from high school in 2017, I attended Lord Fairfax
      Community College to get as many core classes out of the way as possible.
      I graduated with my associate's degree in Business Administration from
      Lord Fairfax. After taking the Summer Semester off, I transferred to Old
      Dominion University as a finance major, but after taking my financial
      management course, I decided that finance was not the correct career path
      for me. Finance was the first major I chose because I was anticipating
      becoming a loan officer at my bank in the future. I realize now that
      finance is not for me and that there is a
      <a href="Aspiring-Career.html">different department of my bank</a> that I
      am hoping to eventually work in. For this reason, I have switched my major
      to Information Technology in hopes to sharpen my technology skills.
