    <p>The Volt is equipped with a 16 kilowatt Hour T-Shaped battery, depicted in the image above. This large 
      battery only has approximately 38 miles of range before the vehicle automatically switches to the <a href="Gas-Generator.html">gas generator.</a>
      Most hybrid vehicles will only use the battery for up to a certain speed and then switch to the gas engine.
      Unlike other hybrid vehicles, the Volt will remain on electric-only power at any speed until the battery is depleted.

      A convenient feature of the Volt's electric drivetrain is that when you release the gas pedal, the electric engine is able
      to use the kinetic energy produced to regenerate electricity back into the battery. This charges the battery a slight amount, while
      simultaneously slowing the vehicle down much more steadily than a gas-powered vehicle, as if you were pressing the brakes. This also 
      helps preserve the vehicle's disc brakes.

    <p style="color: black">Because the Volt is so quiet, it may be difficult for the driver to tell when the vehicle is running.
      For this reason, Chevrolet has installed some power-up and power-down sounds to let the driver know
      when the vehicle has started up or powered down. Here is a clip of the sounds that it makes:
