      The Volt's generator backup is a 1.4 Liter gasoline engine. It requires
      93-octane premium fuel, which can be a major drawback with today's gas
      prices. There are many good qualities of this small engine, though. It
      only has a 9-gallon gas tank, which makes it fairly affordable to fuel.
      Additionally, the engine gets 40 miles per gallon,so that 9 gallons go a
      long way. Oftentimes, the engine works alongside the vehicle's electric
      drivetrain, even when the 16 kilowatt hour battery is depleted. The
      gasoline engine is adequate for over 300 miles on its own. Although the
      driver has the capability of switching from electricity to gas at the 
      touch of a button, the gasoline engine will automatically roar to life
      once the vehicle's computer has determined that the 16 kilowatt hour
      battery has run out of power.

      The driver is able to tell that the engine is running when the blue gas
      tank appears on the right side of their gauge cluster.
