    <h1>The Volt's Interior</h1>
    <p>The Volt has a fairly snug interior. The vehicle is shaped to be as aerodynamic as possible, which makes the roof
      slightly slanted in the rear. This can be annoying to back-seat passengers who happen to be tall.

    <p>As you can see in the picture above, the vehicle does not have a very large trunk, but one would be surprised
      how much can be fit in here. It can also be observed through this picture that the vehicle only has four seats.
      This is because the <a href="Electric-Drive-Train.html">T-shaped battery</a> runs under-floor from the front of 
      the vehicle, down the middle, and into the trunk. For this reason, a fifth seat would compromise space that is needed
      by the battery. Instead, the engineers placed a hump over the battery and placed cup holders. In the second generation
      volt, however, there are five seats. The fifth seat is very cramped, though, as the hump in the middle is still present.

    <p style= "padding-top: 6rem; padding-bottom: 10rem">The Volt is equipped with two seven inch displays. The first display is used in place of the traditional instrument cluster, in
      that they have replaced the traditional analog gauges with a fully digital display. The vehicle also has an infotainment
      system, which houses climate controls, radio controls, and efficiency information.

  <p style= "Padding-top: 4rem; padding-bottom: 4rem">Another interesting feature of the volt, is that it comes stocked from the factory with this air compressor, which is stored
    under the floorboard in the trunk.
    It is removable and can be plugged into any of the vehicle's 3 cigarette lighters. </p>
