    <h1>Basic Information About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is James Higdon, but I go by my middle name, Garrett. I am
      twenty-two years old. I was born and raised in Rixeyville, Virginia, and
      have lived in the Culpeper/Fauquier area for my whole life. After my
      grandfather died in July of 2020, I decided to move in with my
      grandmother, who resides in Warrenton.<br />Although many of the area's
      people are trying hard to move elsewhere, I consider myself to be
      perfectly content right where I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other things about me include that
      <a href="College.html">I am a college student</a>, I work full-time as a
      loan assistant in a small community bank, and I have a
      <a href="aspiring-career.html">career goal</a> that I aspire to obtain.
