      This is where all of the magic happens. Both the gasoline generator and
      the electric motor are proudly wedged side-by-side inside the engine
      compartment. Most of the time, the generator sits quietly and waits for
      its rare opportunity to produce power for the electric engine to use after
      the battery depletes. After the battery depletes, the generator roars to
      life and starts powering the electric engine, while simultaneously
      charging the battery in small increments. The 1.4 liter engine, known as
      the generator, is the same engine that can be found in the Chevrolet
      Cruze, except the cruze has a turbo attached to it. Instead of having a
      turbo, the Volt stores extra power in the battery to use as a power boost
      for when the gas generator struggles to maintain power. This happens even
      when the battery's range is depleted.
